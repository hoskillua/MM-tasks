# Task 2 Topology API

### Solution

- Language Choice: Java
    Reason: Since the api design is clearly based on the Object oriented paradagim, class-based object-oriented programming languages would be the best suit for this task. I considered both C# and Java, but I finally chose Java as I have more Experience in.

- Code analysis tool: Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat
    I used this tool for semantic highlighting and linting.
